Good code review: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/287567/malloc-and-free-implementation

This code review is good because it is clear and constructive in its advice and is written professionally

Bad code review: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/287851/my-drawing-finder

This code review is not that good because the feedback is not very constructive and a bit subjective. Additionally, it doesn't talk too much about what the coder requested. To make this better, I would focus my criticisms more on the functionality of the code rather than the appearance.
